Humility grounds us. It acknowledges that we all participate in the human experience. Our desire is to soar, be recognized, and accomplish great things. Humility reminds us that these great things can be accomplished with or without us. In our day-to-day life we may even share more with animals than what we consider enlightened human values. This does not mean that we should revert to primal behavior. Instead, we should embrace the humanity not only within ourselves, but with everyone on this planet: past, present, and future. In doing so, we acknowledge that there are things that make each individual unique, but no individual more inherently valuable than another. We keep this in mind as we work towards bettering ourselves, not to be better than others, but to better humankind.
