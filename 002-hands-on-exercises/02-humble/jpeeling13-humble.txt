What does being humble mean to me? I think it means never putting yourself in a place where you feel someone else is beneath you.
Humility is being patient, being a good listener, slow to speak, and willing to put others before yourself. You can still have self-confidence
in yourself and what you can do, but being humble means allowing actions to speak louder than words. Being humble means admitting your mistakes, admitting that
other people can do it better than you, or admitting that you don't know how to do it at all. Humble people are good learners. They have wisdom. They can see
the world as other people see it, from other peoples' shoes, not just their own.
