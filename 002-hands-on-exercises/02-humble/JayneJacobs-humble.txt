Very good question and this did make me think a bit though I am making up my 
mind as I type.

What does it mean to me to be humble? It means being slow to speak and listening
carefully to others. It also means remembering that I am not the center of the universe, 
only the center of my own universe. I try to remember there are as many perspectives as
there are people and each are valid frome their own vantage point. 

Today I am trying to put other's first as  you mentioned. That does seem like humility to me,
though I am still thinking it over.
