Being humble means recognising first and formost that I am fundamentally human. That I am made up of the same fundamental elements and materials as dogs, and worms, and flies.

That aquiring wealth by the accident of my birth; or by the accident of my brain being wired in such a way that I am more "intelligent" than my next neighbour, does not confer superiority of self over them. Relative to the universe, we are insignificant.
