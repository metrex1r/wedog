To me, being humble means letting my work and my actions speak for themselves. It is knowing the difference between taking pride
and being prideful. It is okay to be proud of an accomplishment, but there is a fine line between sharing what has been achieved and bragging, 
and it varies from listener to listener. It also means owning your mistakes, and being willing to learn from them. A humble person will use
their mistake as an experience to learn and become better, whereas a prideful person will never admit to being wrong and therefore won't grow.
