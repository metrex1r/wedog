To me being humble is knowing that no matter how much I know there is always more to learn and there are different ways to do things other than the way that I do them.  I (along with everyone else) was born with only survival instincts... everything after that has been learned and might not have been learned in the best way.  I believe it is important to listen to others, be open to their methods and be happy to show them what I know while explaining to them that there might be better ways.

It's also important to remember that I am only one of ~7 billion people so it is impossible to be the best at what I do.  I strive to be the best that I can be, but I wont be the best in the world which is comforting to know that there are people to learn from.

Some skills that I am not good at I can try to learn, but it is ok to get help from others to achieve the best results.
