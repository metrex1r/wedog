Being willing to be humbled is an important quality.

We all have egoic pride. This pride wants to be right; doesn't want to look bad; doesn't want to be wrong.

Being humble means ignoring this egoic pride. Being humble means being willing to learn. Being humble means being willing and able to say "I don't know" and "I am sorry. I didn't do that correctly. Please teach me. Please forgive me. Please help me learn."

To be humble is to put your "self" second to improving, becoming better, and working more effectively with others - even living more for others instead of your "self."

It is important to be humble, and to allow your "self" to be humbled.

That's what being humble means to me.
