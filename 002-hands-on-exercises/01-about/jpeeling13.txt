years started coding: 2013-2016 then took a hiatus until 2020. Now I'm starting to get back into it.
coding strengths (comma seperated list): html, css, javascript, React.js, Go, PostgreSQL
anything you want to share about yourself: I absolutely love to cook, and one day hope to be a chef of my own restaurant. Until then I'm happily learning to code. I'm originally from the Baltimore, MD area but will be moving into a van full time with my wife within the next 3-6 months. Hello West Coast!
