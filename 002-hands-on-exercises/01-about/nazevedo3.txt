coding strengths (comma separated list): Learning Go from Todd.
anything you want to share about yourself:  I currently work as a Network Engineer and with the help of Todd's courses on Go, I've been able to build tools to automate redundant daily tasks.  He's inspired me to transition into Sofware Engieering.  I'm a big fan of your courses and HOW you teach them.  Thanks Todd!
