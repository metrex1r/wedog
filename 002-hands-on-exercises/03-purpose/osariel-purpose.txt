The top assumes human need meaning in their lives. I am not sure what having purpose and meaning in life actually means. Pilling everything down to it's core, it seems to mean, that even if life has a purpose, we don't know what it is. Primarily, we satisfy these two basic things, hunger and procreation. Everything other thing is an addition, and serves these two fundamental goals; be it houses, cars, clothes, relationships etc.
